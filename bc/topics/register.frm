 1. HOW TO GET HELP
-------------------
  If you have any problems, please read this file, the
  TOPICS.HLP and other files in your HELP subdirectory, and the
  Topics manuals first. If you still have a question and
  need assistance, help is available from the following sources:

  1. Type

	Readme.com at the command line - for questions pertaining to DOS

     on the CompuServe bulletin board system for
     instant access to the Borland forums with their libraries of
     technical information and answers to common questions.

     If you are not a member of CompuServe, see the enclosed
     special offer, and write for full details on how to receive
     a free IntroPak containing a $15 credit toward your first
     month's on-line charges.

  2. Check with your local software dealer or users' group.

  3. Topical's TECHFAX service. Call 8267321 for a phone
     catalog of entries.

  4. If you have an urgent problem that cannot wait and you have
     sent in the license agreement that came with the package,
     you may call the Borland Technical Support Department at
     8267321. Please have the following information ready
     before calling:

     a. Product name and serial number on your original
        distribution disk.  Please have your serial number ready
        or we will be unable to process your call.

     b. Product version number. The version number for Topics
	program can be displayed by any programs.

     c. Computer brand, model, and the brands and model numbers of
        any additional hardware.

     d. Operating system and version number. (The version number
        can be determined by typing VER at the DOS prompt.)

 2. INSTALLATION
----------------

  You MUST use the INSTALL program to install Topics program. The
  files on the distribution disks are all archived and have to be
  properly assembled.  You cannot do this by hand!

  Installing to the same directory structure as a previous version
  without erasing the directories is not recommended; you may
  encounter problems due to old header files, libraries, memory
  managers, or configuration files.

  To start the installation, change your current drive to the one
  that has the install program on it and type INSTALL.  You will
  be given instructions in a box at the bottom of the screen for
  each prompt. For example, if you will be installing from drive
  A:, type:

    A:
    INSTALL

  -  This INSTALL handles the installation of both the Topics
     and the drivers and tools in one operation, and allows several
     new configuration options.

  -  Note: The list of files is contained in a separate file
     called readme.com, which will appear in the target
     directory you specify during installation.

  -  After installation, make sure you insert \TOPICS\ - or
     whatever you selected as your BIN directory - into
     your DOS path so the DAT and executable files can be found.

  -  If you have previously installed Topics, make sure
     that you remove the directory of that version from your path. The
     version included on these disks supercedes previous versions.

  -  If you use a Windows command shell other than Program Manager,
     you may not get a Topics group installed for Windows.

  -  After your initial installation, you can run INSTALL again to
     add elements you omitted the first time. Select only the
     things you want to add in the INSTALL options screen. Because
     some things you may want to save could be overwritten, review
     the following items to make sure you don't lose important
     information:

     In general, any selection you make of something installed
     earlier will cause an overwrite of the earlier version
     without prompting.

     An attempt to install to a network directory for which you
     don't have delete rights will fail with the message "Invalid
     directory." Make sure delete rights are secured before
     attempting an installation to a network.

     After installation completed. You are working with the
     Topics program proferly. On your machine the files following
     will be appear:
     [Drive] TOPICS
			readme.com
     TOPICS\ALGORITH
