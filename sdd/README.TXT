About SciTech Display Doctor
----------------------------
SciTech Display Doctor is a suite of utilities that fix the most common
problems associated with Super VGA (SVGA) graphics cards. SciTech Display
Doctor updates your graphics card to the latest standards so you can be sure
programs will work correctly and will run as fast as possible on your system.
Many popular games like The 11th Hour, Quake and Duke Nukem 3D rely on the
latest VESA graphics standards in order to obtain the highest performance
possible.


Benefits of SciTech Display Doctor
----------------------------------
*  Plug & Play.  SciTech Display Doctor will automatically detect your
   graphics card and make your SuperVGA software work properly. You don't
   have to try and figure out what kind of graphics chip you have and then
   try to track down your vendor for a possible software upgrade. If you
   ever change your graphics card, SciTech Display Doctor will automatically
   detect the change and reconfigure itself for your new hardware.

*  Compatibility.  SciTech Display Doctor will make your graphics card
   compatible with the latest standards. If your graphics card has bugs,
   SciTech Display Doctor can fix them and make it so you can run your
   favorite graphics applications without errors.

*  Performance.  SciTech Display Doctor will generally increase the
   performance of all software that uses VESA VBE standards. If your
   graphics card only supports an older version of the VESA VBE standard,
   you will get significant additional performance improvements with
   application software that uses the newer VBE 3.0 or 2.0 standard.

*  Money and Energy Saving.  SciTech Display Doctor can save you money and
   help the environment at the same time. It fully supports the VESA
   hardware and software power management protocol standards (VBE/PM and
   DPMS) for Energy Star compliance. It comes with the Green Saver power
   management screen saver that allows you to power down an Energy Star
   compliant monitor when you are not using your computer. Since a monitor
   uses 50-80% of the energy consumed in a computer system, Green Saver can
   result in a substantial energy savings over the life of your computer.
   Even the built in Windows 95 screen saver interface requires VESA VBE/PM
   to work properly.

*  3D and Video Acceleration in Software.  SciTech Display Doctor enables
   3D and video acceleration in software by automatically creating new
   high-performance modes on your graphics card that allows software,
   especially interactive games and digital video, to run faster and with
   better quality than before. It does this by requiring applications to
   move less data to the graphics card, while still maintaining high quality
   graphics.

*  Protected Mode/Linear Buffer Support.  Many of the latest programs
   support VESA VBE 2.0's 32-bit protected mode interface giving you as much
   as 2-3 times the performance of the older VESA interface. Very few
   graphics cards have implemented the VBE 2.0 standard and even fewer yet
   have implemented 3.0, so SciTech Display Doctor may be the only way that
   you can use the VESA VBE 3.0 standard for maximum graphics performance.

*  Accelerator Support.  SciTech Display Doctor is the first product to
   support the new VESA VBE/AF (Accelerator Functions) standard. VBE/AF
   allows applications and operating systems to take advantage of full
   graphics hardware acceleration.

*  Display Centering.  SciTech Display Doctor includes the UniCenter program
   for centering and sizing the display image on your monitor. UniCenter
   allows you to adjust the centering and sizing for all graphics modes
   supported by SciTech Display Doctor. It's great for getting those graphics
   modes to look just right on your monitor.

*  Global Refresh Rate Control.  SciTech Display Doctor provides support for
   controlling the refresh rate of your graphics card for the Windows 95
   desktop, regardless of which display drivers you are using. The new
   refresh rate control mechanism works for all graphics cards that SciTech
   Display Doctor supports, including both VGA and NonVGA controllers. It
   also works even if your display drivers already contain a refresh rate
   control. You have the option to use our refresh control (and control both
   VESA and Windows modes) or the default mechanism for Windows modes
   provided by your display driver.

*  Refresh Rate Control.  The UniCenter program also allows you to control
   the refresh rate on most supported graphics cards, so you can set your
   display for the highest possible flicker-free image in each graphics mode.

*  Stereo Support.  SciTech Display Doctor now has the ability to use
   hardware stereo flipping and stereo signaling. This will allow your
   applications to run via hardware so that they can run faster and require
   fewer memory resources.

*  VESA GTF Support.  SciTech Display Doctor can use the VESA GTF
   (Generalized Timing Formula) standard to automatically calculate exact
   refresh rates and display sizing. This makes centering graphics modes much
   easier.

*  Compatibility Testing.  SciTech Display Doctor includes VBETest, the
   de-facto standard test for compliance with VESA software standards. You
   can test your graphics card with and without SciTech Display Doctor to
   see if your graphics card is working properly. If your graphics card
   driver fails VBETest, you will probably experience problems when trying
   to run real world software.

*  Performance Profiling.  SciTech Display Doctor includes display profiling
   programs that allow you to test raw bandwidth of your graphics subsystem.
   The profiling programs are low-level hardware oriented tests that can tell
   you the baseline performance level of your card.

List of all supported chips
---------------------------
This is a complete list of the various graphics cards that SciTech Display
Doctor supports. Please note that this list refers to the actual chips being
used, not a board-level implementation. Thus you will not see any products
from Hercules or Orchid on the list, but their products are supported because
they use S3, Cirrus, Tseng, etc. chips. Also, any card with less than 512KB
of memory cannot be supported in SciTech Display Doctor.

Cards Supported with Full Acceleration
--------------------------------------
The VBE/AF (Accelerator Functions) are a superset of the VBE 2.0 functions.
SciTech Display Doctor creates a VBE/AF driver for all supported cards.
Currently, SciTech Display Doctor only supports the superset functions of
VBE/AF on the cards listed below. On all other cards, VBE/AF is supported,
but it is only supported at the same level of functionality as VBE 2.0.
Hence, there will be little or no performance increase on cards other than
the ones listed below.

Cards Supported with VBE/SCI Serial Control Interface
-----------------------------------------------------
This standard enables new types of communication between a graphics
controller and a monitor, while making existing communications functions
more standardized. It allows Plug and Play information to be returned from
the display in a standard way as well as enabling future applications that
can control the properties of your monitor (brightness, contrast, centering
and sizing) from your computer using the keyboard and mouse instead of via
cryptic and hard-to-use On Screen Controls embedded in the monitor.
